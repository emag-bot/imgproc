# imgproc
This project is a gearman worker that finds similar images to the one that was requested. This is done using opencv for object extraction and computes image hue histogram as an heuristic for finding similar images in a MySQL database.

This is a hackathon project so bad code is a requirement, or at least that's what i tell to myself.
